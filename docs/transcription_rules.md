📝 Transcription Rules — Zaan Koshur
Standardized writing guidelines for the Kashmiri language dataset

These rules ensure that all transcriptions across contributors remain consistent, machine-readable, and linguistically accurate. All contributors, reviewers, and dataset processors must follow these guidelines strictly.

🔤 1. Script Choice

Zaan Koshur uses the Perso-Arabic script (Nastaliq) for transcription.

Example:

"I am going home" → بے گَھراس چَھ آنئ

🔡 2. Lowercase Standard

All text must be written in lowercase, even if the script itself does not differentiate capital letters.

⏳ 3. No Punctuation (Except When Necessary)

Avoid punctuation unless required for clarity or meaning.

❌ Wrong:
                                                                               بے گَھراس چَھ آنئ۔

✔ Correct:
                                                                                بے گَھراس چَھ آنئ

🔊 4. Write What Is Spoken (Not Corrected Urdu/Hindi)

The transcription must match the exact spoken Kashmiri, not the grammatically corrected or intended sentence.

If speaker says:

مۍ چُھ گَھراس گَچّان

Do NOT change to Standard Kashmiri unless that is exactly what they said.

🗣 5. Do Not Translate

The transcription should be a literal representation of what was spoken.
Do NOT translate it into another language or dialect.

➕ 6. Normalize Common Kashmiri Spellings

Use standardized spellings for:

Word	Standard Form
me / I	مۍ

you	تُہ

he	یو

she	یِم

home	گَر

come	آو

go	گَچ

eat	کأہ

drink	چھُہ

(We will expand this list as the dataset grows.)

🔁 7. Elongations & Emphasis

If speaker extends a sound, transcribe normally:

Speaker: "بہہہہہ"
Write as: بہ

Do NOT add extra characters for long intonation.

💬 8. Filler Words

Use these tags for filler sounds:

[uh] → small hesitation

[ah] → breathy pause

[hmm] → acknowledgement

Example:

بے [uh] گَژھان

🔉 9. Non-Speech Sounds

Use square brackets:

[noise] — background noise

[laughter] — speaker laughs

[cough] — speaker coughs

[breath] — inhaling/exhaling

Example:

[noise] مۍ چُھ آوان [laughter]

😶‍🌫 10. Mispronunciations

Write exactly as spoken, even if incorrect.

If speaker says:

بے گَھرا چَھ گتشان

Do NOT correct to:

بے گَھراس چَھ گَچّان

🪐 11. Foreign Words & Names

Write Kashmiri pronunciation, not English spelling.

Example:

“Mobile” → موبایل
“Laptop” → لیپٹوپ
